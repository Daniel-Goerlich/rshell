Description
-----------

This program has been designed in order to run commands like Bash. In the 
project's current state, it is able to exectue basic commands. You can end the
program by typing "exit" when you see the prompt ("$ "). Note: The program
will run until the user runs the custom built "exit" command.

1.) only 1024 characters can be entered in as a command

2.) cd only works when used alone

3.) cd does not recognize comments and will try to convert comments into a path 

4.) the exit command must be exaclty as "exit" any additional characters will cause an error
